Here is some introduction to my assignment:

My code is implemented via formula from my report, please read my report first to understand my work better. 
There are also some notes of my code in my report.

I put the data inside folder "data"

There are some .py files:
+ main.py: where I process input and conduct experiment.
+ MLP_test_small_data.py: where I test my coding for smaller dataset first and it helps me to debug better.
+ MyMLP.py: A class reimplement the MLP. I tried to use some function names quite similar to sklearn for easier debugging and implementing.
+ Visualization.py: where I use it in main.py to visualize experiment.
+ test.py: where I test some python syntax.

Happy reading and thank you for this assignment. I have gained a lot from it.
